# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 2019-12-14

**Today's Progress**: Got started, installed [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) in VS Code and decided to dive into learning React.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
