### Day 14: 2019-12-28

**Today´s Progress:** I added Grumpy Cat to the images :) I refactored cards and styles for them - now they are positioned in rows and coloumns and have a hover effect.

**Thoughts:** Next feature to implement will be a flip-effect like the one here: [https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_flip_card.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_flip_card.asp)

### Day 13: 2019-12-27

**Today´s Progress:** Refactored a bit and added control for a matching couple of selected cards.

**Thoughts:** Maybe control logic needs to be refactored.

### Day 12: 2019-12-26

**Today´s Progress:** Added up and down arrows and text to specify sorting order of history items. Started a new React project - a memory game. UPDATE: I added and got some code working. The code can now shuffle a deck of cards. Thanks goes out to @filsmyth for providing me with images of his kitties :)

**Thoughts:** Learned about how to use HTML Entities in JSX from [https://shripadk.github.io/react/docs/jsx-gotchas.html](https://shripadk.github.io/react/docs/jsx-gotchas.html). Concatenating using a system parameter proved to be a bit of trouble but I managed to get it to work :)

### Day 10: 2019-12-24

**Today´s Progress:** Implemented optional feature 6. I started working on setting button value using state.

**Thoughts:** I haven´t quite figured out how to use state the best way.. yet :)

### Day 9: 2019-12-23

**Today´s Progress:** Implemented 3rd optional feature - refactoring to using two nested loops instead of hardcoded board.

**Thoughts:** I would rather have used for-loops instead of mapping an array - but then I got a little practice using those :)

### Day 8: 2019-12-22

**Today´s Progress:** Removed mark of winning combination when clicking through items in history list. Helped @tbaglioni with his FTP project. Started looking into how to implement optional feature 4 - loops in loops. Internet suggests using ES6 map method.

**Thoughts:** Tried implementing with two nested loops - will try with map method tomorrow.

### Day 7: 2019-12-21

**Today´s Progress:** I implemented the fifth optional feature in the tutorial and I refactored a few styles.

**Thoughts:** I am not using React state when setting/getting the winning combination - except from that I am pretty pleased with the outcome. Hmmm.. I might want to find a way to refactor.

### Day 6: 2019-12-20

**Today´s Progress:** Stuck on finding a way to set state of the winning combination.

**Thoughts:** I may have to refactor the app to solve the days problem.

### Day 5: 2019-12-19

**Today´s Progress:** I helped @tbaglioni a bit with his coding environment and revoked my own terminal back to using canvas again. (No more problems with not being able to break code execution with CTRL + C). Add a few style changes. Implemented optional feature 2 - bold selected history item.

**Thoughts:** Started implementing optional feature 5 and got to think about best practice of setting state in React. Will look into that tomorrow.

### Day 4: 2019-12-18

**Today´s Progress:** Today I helped @tbaglioni with [this commit](https://github.com/tbaglioni/100-days-of-code/commit/ccfe907cab3d4ffc4b7b50532040a887ba996c5f). I haven´t made any progress on yesterdays issue .. yet :) UPDATE: I changed a few styles on the buttons. UPDATE: I changed the code so it now shows coordinates on the history buttons ... yeaaiihh :)

**Thoughts:** Not many #emptyhead :) UPDATE: Using arrays for coordinates in React state was trouble. Refactoring so it resembles history array/object struture proved to be the solution :)

### Day 3: 2019-12-17

**Today´s Progress:** Added styles to current square.

**Thoughts:** I got confused about what the first optional task said. I tried to implement a mark of the current square - the task asked for a coordinate set on each step in the history list. I tried to implement that... WIP :)

### Day 2: 2019-12-16

**Today´s Progress:** I am working on implementing this first optional improvement - display location for each move when clicking history list item. Added a CSS class to better mark which square is the current one.

**Thoughts:** I am stuck on how to pass down and use arrays as parameters to a method. They seem to be passed as arrays but I cannot loop over them.

### Day 1: 2019-12-15

**Today´s Progress:** I managed to get to a finished game to work:)

**Thoughts:** Starting from where I left off yesterday and worked to the end without much hassle. Tomorrow I will look into implementing the optional improvements mentioned [here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#wrapping-up)

### Day 0: 2019-12-14

**Today's Progress:** Got started, installed [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) in VS Code and decided to dive into learning React.

**Thoughts:** Will add in an hour or so :) ... here they are: Starting learning React isn´t that bad. I got to this step [Lifting State Up](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#lifting-state-up) .. and I will continue tomorrow.
