# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 2019-12-14

**Today's Progress:** Got started, installed [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) in VS Code and decided to dive into learning React.

**Thoughts:** Will add in an hour or so :) ... here they are: Starting learning React isn´t that bad. I got to this step [Lifting State Up](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#lifting-state-up) .. and I will continue tomorrow.
