### Day 4: 2019-12-18

**Today´s Progress:** Today I helped @tbaglioni with [this commit](https://github.com/tbaglioni/100-days-of-code/commit/ccfe907cab3d4ffc4b7b50532040a887ba996c5f). I haven´t made any progress on yesterdays issue .. yet :) UPDATE: I changed a few styles on the buttons. UPDATE: I changed the code so it now shows coordinates on the history buttons ... yeaaiihh :)

**Thoughts:** Not many #emptyhead :) UPDATE: Using arrays for coordinates in React state was trouble. Refactoring so it resembles history array/object struture proved to be the solution :)

### Day 3: 2019-12-17

**Today´s Progress:** Added styles to current square.

**Thoughts:** I got confused about what the first optional task said. I tried to implement a mark of the current square - the task asked for a coordinate set on each step in the history list. I tried to implement that... WIP :)

### Day 2: 2019-12-16

**Today´s Progress:** I am working on implementing this first optional improvement - display location for each move when clicking history list item. Added a CSS class to better mark which square is the current one.

**Thoughts:** I am stuck on how to pass down and use arrays as parameters to a method. They seem to be passed as arrays but I cannot loop over them.

### Day 1: 2019-12-15

**Today´s Progress:** I managed to get to a finished game to work:)

### Day 0: 2019-12-14

**Today's Progress:** Got started, installed [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) in VS Code and decided to dive into learning React.

**Thoughts:** Will add in an hour or so :) ... here they are: Starting learning React isn´t that bad. I got to this step [Lifting State Up](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#lifting-state-up) .. and I will continue tomorrow.
